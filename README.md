# MFA Code Generator and Validator

## Overview

This project implements an app for generating and validating Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) codes using Kafka for messaging, Redis for storing codes, and an email service for sending codes to users.

## Instructions

### clone the repository
---
### create a .env file in the project root directory and add your email credentials:
```SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@example.com``` \
```SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password```

I'm using gmail account. Configuring an SMTP server might be required:
- Go to the email account from which you want to send the email.
- Select Manage your Google account.
- In the search bar, search App passwords
- Complete the two-step verification if you havenâ€™t done it before.
- Select app (other in this case) and click Generate.
- Now you will see the generated app password.

### Build and run the application using Docker Compose
```docker-compose up --build```

## Usage

Generate MFA Code: Send a POST request to ```/api/v1/mfa/generation``` with an email in the body.

---

Validate MFA Code: Send a POST request to ```/api/v1/mfa/validation``` with the code.

## Example Requests

Generate MFA Code

```curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/mfa/generation -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user@example.com"}'```

---

Validate MFA Code

```curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/mfa/validation -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"code": "123456"}'```
